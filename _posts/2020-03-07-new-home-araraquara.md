This week has been a roller-coaster, some weeks ago I finally got my transfer of major accepted, It was a big change going from Mechanical Engineering to Languages, and to be honest, I'm looking forward to start with this course, I'm pretty hype to get this rolling. 

It has been wild because I was living in Bauru for 2 years, I was pretty established doing an internship and having everything at our house (I was renting a house with some friends), and going once again to a new city where I don't know anyone it's pretty challenging but gets me really excited to do this kind of stuff. I love going to new places and just go with the flow. 

I moved out from Bauru on Thursday, came with just 2 backpacks and nothing else. I pretty much have to buy everything, once again, and my money is kinda low but I'll make through it. 

> P.d: Air Mattresses are pretty uncomfortable, It does help to have somewhere to crash but geeez, try to get a bed ASAP. 

Just wanted to record this moment of bliss, I'm feeling pretty excited with this decision and looking forward for what Araraquara has to offer.
