## Overview 
Selenium is a free (open source) automated testing suite for web applications across different browsers and platforms. It is quite similar to HP Quick Test Pro (QTP now UFT) only that Selenium focuses on automating web-based applications.

## Usage 
This week I somewhat challenge myself to try to automate things on my job work. I saw that most of the administrative stuff on the Finance team was still manual and got me think that maybe me should automate it. This is where Selenium comes handy. Basically the whole idea is to automate the whole process and leave to run daily. What I did encounter was some problems while processing the automation, my pc is somewhat slow and might not load the page properpy, the other option might be using headless. Anyways, I'll run some tests and try to create some scripts to automate stuff.
