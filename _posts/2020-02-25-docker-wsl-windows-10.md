This week I began some testing with Docker, I gotta say it didn't work as I expected, the installation was pretty straightforward, of course, but since I'm developing with Django I gave me some issues with Postgresql, whenever I tried to migrated it just didnt work at all, it gave me some issues, it ran smoothly with sqlite so I decided to look for options. 

Eventually I started using a VM with Ubuntu and it work flawlesly, but my point is not to use a vm since it needs alot of my pc resources and my pc isn't that great.
