This is the current stack that I'm using for this website. 

## Framework 
I'm using `Jekyll` as my framework to develop this site. 
`Jekyll` is a static site generator. You give it text written in your favorite markup language and it uses layouts to create a static website. You can tweak how you want the site URLs to look, what data gets displayed on the site, and more.

## Theme
I'm using [Type](https://github.com/aspirethemes/type), it's Minimal and Clean Free Jekyll Theme, just did small modifications and it was ready to roll. 

## Hosting
Netlify is an all-in-one platform for automating modern web projects. Replace your hosting infrastructure, continuous integration, and deployment pipeline with a single workflow. Integrate dynamic functionality like serverless functions, user authentication, and form handling.

## CMS
[Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) is an open source content management system for your Git workflow that enables you to provide editors with a friendly UI and intuitive workflows. You can use it with any static site generator to create faster, more flexible web projects. Content is stored in your Git repository alongside your code for easier versioning, multi-channel publishing, and the option to handle content updates directly in Git.

## Email
I'm using [Zoho Forever Free Plan](https://www.zoho.com/mail/zohomail-pricing.html), since it lets me use my domain name. No added price.
