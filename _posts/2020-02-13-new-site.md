Recently I created my blog that it was hosted on Heroku, the techonologies that I used was Django, Postgres and Heroku of course, but I didn't like how it felt. I wanted something more lightweight, some time ago I started reading about Hugo, Jekyll, Pelican and other frameworks and got really interested, because they where really fast and easy to setup and you can host them everywhere without the need of having your own server.

This website it's currently running with the following techonlogies:
## Framework 
I'm using `Jekyll` as my framework to develop this site. 
`Jekyll` is a static site generator. You give it text written in your favorite markup language and it uses layouts to create a static website. You can tweak how you want the site URLs to look, what data gets displayed on the site, and more.
