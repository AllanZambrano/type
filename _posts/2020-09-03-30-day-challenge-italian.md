## Objective

The idea of the 30 day challenge is to basically force myself to write and read Italian in 30 days. The is not getting a to a fluent level, but to a conversational level as minimum. 

## How

There's different approaches that I would like to take, this includes:

* Watching videos
* Blog/Vlog
* Read
* Listen to music
* Flashcards
* Talking

I'll see how it goes, but at the moment the idea is to blog every day over here and just try to communicate in Italian. 

Wish me luck.
