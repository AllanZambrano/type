So I while back I gave a small course of intro to Django, I was pretty excited, and it was alright, there's some things I need to change and improve but I think it went alright, so the idea is to basically improve the small course and post over here. It's basically a How-To create a small blog using Django Class based view. It was pretty fun to come up with this guide and I hope I can create more projects involving python and Django.

Here's the link of the code that we used and eventually I'll post the guide over here.
