This week has been somewhat frustrating, the project that I'm currently working on is a basic bash script that lets me access to one server and lets me create a CSV regarding about the email usage from the users, after that the script does an SCP to transfer the file locally and save on my Usage folder. The thing is I wanted to automate it to send it via email, I had 2 options but I didn't find a way to make it work so that got me frustrated and made me rethink the process. The options I had were the following: 


## Bash Script
Steps:
1. SSH to the server.
2. Create a CSV.
3. Upload it to transfer.sh
4. Save the output on a variable.
5. Print the variable on the body of SendGrid. 
6.  Send the email with the link.


## Python Script
Steps:
1. SSH to the server.
2. Create a CSV.
3. Login through SCP
4. Download the file and save it locally or external server.
5. Run SenGrid python script.


## Conclusion
For now, Transfer.sh option gave me some headaches so I will try with the Python script. I understand that through SCP I can just leave the file on the folder, but I would like to have a reminder on my email of that file, probably saying something like "Your file is ready!".

I might be overthinking the process or spending too much time on something that isn't worth it but it's just hella fun to try to automate things. Anyways, looking forward to testing the Python Script.
