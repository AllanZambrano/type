Since I'm using Jekyll as my framework there's technically no dashboard or admin that can let us do the changes online or at least that's what I thought. I was doing everything manually on VS code and I wasn't liking it to be honest, at this point is where I encounter with Netlify CMS.

Netlify CMS is an open-source content management system for your Git workflow that enables you to provide editors with a friendly UI and intuitive workflows. This means that it creates a nice UI on our domain/admin URL that lets us interact with the site posts, basically a CRUD.
The setup is pretty straightforward, just follow the tutorials and you should be up and running it in a blink of an eye.
