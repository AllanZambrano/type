Hi, my name is Allan Zambrano. PEC-G Student & software developer wannabe, currently living in Brazil.
At the moment i'm undergoing my studies in Mechanical Engineering in UNESP. I started this website
as a place to document everything I learn on a daily basis, troubleshooting, sysadmin, programming or even life. The idea is to create some guides for future reference and create the habit of documenting everything.
